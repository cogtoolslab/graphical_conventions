# Graphical conventions: learning from iterated visual communication
How do people agree on ways of communicating visual concepts?


## workflow

- **Run human experiments**
  - communication task (`/experiments/draw_chairs/`)
    - Input: Shapenet chair collection and experimental design
    - Output: human sketches and viewer decisions over time, communication efficiency timecourse
  - recognition task (`/experiments/recog_chairs/`) 
    - Input: sketches from communication task and 3D objects
    - Output: sketch recognizability in context (4 objects) w/o interaction history

- **Analyze human task performance data**
  - `/analysis/golden/generate_refgame_dataframe.py`
    - Input: raw mongo database records
    - Output: tidy formatted dataframes containing key behavioral measures (`XX.csv`, `BIS.csv`)
  - `/analysis/golden/analyze_refgame_data.Rmd`
    - Input: tidy dataframe generated by `generate_refgame_dataframe.py`
    - Output: timecourse visualizations of key behavioral variables; results of linear mixed effects modeling of timecourse

- **Model-based analyses of sketch data**
  - `/analysis/golden/analyze_sketch_features.py`

- **Write paper**
  - Cogsci`https://github.com/judithfan/graphical_conventions_latex`
