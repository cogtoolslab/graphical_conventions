## pilot2

June 3 2018

Manipulate cost of drawing by imposing time limit for each trial. Do this by having animated countdown bar. Try this with 30s timeout, which should be more than enough for each trial, but makes the time cost of each trial more salient.  

Otherwise design is identical to pilot1


### pilot1

Aug 30 2017 [aka "pilot1"]

launch: Sep 20 2017

Implemented re-design of sketchpad_repeated.

Each pair now only sees objects from one of the categories (birds, chairs, cars, dogs), each containing 8 objects.

There are three phases to this experiment: 
    - pre: All 8 objects sketched 
    - repeating: A subset of 4 objects sketched 4 times each, mini-blocked. 
    - post: All 8 objects sketched again

For a total of 8 + 16 + 8 = 32 trials total.

We want to counterbalance the category assignment across pairs.

Target pilot sample size: 4 * 5 = 20 pairs (matching sketchpad_basic size).


### pilot0

May 31 2017 [aka "pilot0"; not saved to mongo due to ransomware thing]

"sketchpad_repeated" is a close variant of the "sketchpad" experiment.

There are four categories containing eight objects each. The categories are: birds, chairs, cars, dogs.

Objects were grouped into eight quartets: Four of these quartets contained objects from the same category ("close"); the other four of these quartets contained objects from different categories ("far").

On each trial, one quartet of objects shown. The sketcher's task was to make a sketch of the cued object such that the viewer could identify it from the quartet.

In this experiment, one of the "close" quartets will be presented 16 times, such that each object serves as the target four times across the session. One of the "far" quartets will also be repeated 16 times.

The remaining three "close" and three "far" quartets will be presented four times each, such that each object serves as the target at least once. Thus, these trials are identical to those in the original "sketchpad" experiment conducted in April 2017.

In other words, in addition to the "close" vs. "far" manipulation, we are also manipulating whether a quartet is "repeated" or presented only "once."

Total number of trials = 14 * 4 = 56
